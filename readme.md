Avoiding all analyses of the 'effectiveness' of ICU (i.e. effect of decision to admit, or early admission)
Factors affecting outcome for patients _not_ admitted
Examining the effect of occupancy
	- in the frailty model allows for confounding by hospital
	- but removes the effect of hospital	that operates _through_ occupancy
Recast results to emphasise interest in outcomes of patients referred to and not immediately admitted (esp. those with a recommendation for critical care)

inbox:
	- run survival model at 7d as single level
	- double check occupancy order in markdown now you have re-levelled room_cmp2 
	- check levels of age category predictors in models (k1 not k0 as baseline)
	- bootstrap CI 
		- check/read about which SE to use after bootstrap (simple vs ...)
			at present assuming central limit theorem holds and sampling by bootstrap creates this distn then use Z
	- convert incidence model to per 1000 admission metric
	- sensitivity analyses - check thresholds


paper:
	abstract:
		- 95%CI for delay when refusing admission
		- 95%CI for delay with high occupancy
	intro:
		- refocus using themes in Chen VA paper and Stelfox paper
		- explain concept of tracking patients not admitted
			emphasise USP that we have followed all patients
	methods:
		- explain why mortality analysis in subgroup of patients rejected
		- add in 
			Cox proportional hazards were used to model survival with a shared frailty (random effect) for hospitals which was is reported as a Median Hazard Ratio (MHR).[Bengtsson and Dribe, 2010, #60939] The proportional hazards assumption was checked by inspecting plots of smoothed exponentiated standardised SchoÃ«nfeld residuals, and re-entering terms using time-varying co-efficients where necessary.
	
	results:
		
		- determinants of decision to admit
			- convert predicted additional	admissions to percentages
				 We estimated that in this sample had there been no limitations on capacity then an additional 122 patients (95\%CI 53-186) would have been admitted.
		
		- add back in incidence per 1000 admissions
			see old working
		
		- sort out table and figure numbering
		- comments to move to the discussion
			- suggesting that, unless there are unmeasured patient level risk factors more important than those already measured, this variability is not due to incomplete risk adjustment.
		
		- add decision making into survival model 
			not because you are interested in its effect, but because you wish to examine the MHR after adjusting for decision - and whether or not that is how 'site' contributes to outcome
			- estimate model
			- report/comment if makes a difference to MHR
			- add note into results re this
		- add in mortality in first 7 days vs 90 days - perhaps to supp figure caption
	
	
	
	
	
	discussion:
		you are going to write about how the factors in play at the bedside assessment affect decision making, care and outcome
		you can safely leave the causal pathway of	decision making acting through delivery of care to the IV paper 
	
	figures:
		
		- figure 1 (strobe plus pathways)
			- a strobe
			- b recommended
			- c decision
		- figure 2 (time2icu) @next
			borrow from spot early code
		
		- supplementary
			- incidence and case finding
			- daily hazard
			- severity of illness and outcome
			- critical care occupancy
			- schoenfeld_residuals_icnarc_score.jpg
		
		- maybe
			- time 2 icu figure
	
	tables:
		
		- table 1 (baseline characteristics)
			- modifications 
						- with age categories
						- peri-arrest status
						- assessment timing
		
		- table 2 (occupancy effects)
		- convert to tables 3a and 3b
			- table 3 (determinants of decision to admit)
			- table 4 (determinants of prompt admission)
		- add early admission and decision to admit into the survival model? @today
		- table 4 
			add as additional column to table 3?
		
		
		- supplementary
			- incidence table
				- caption
					The bottom line shows the monthly incidence of patients categorised by NEWS Risk Class referred to, and assessed on the ward by critical care. Above this, incidence rate ratios (IRR) with 95%CI	are reported for hospital, and timing factors. 
		
		- maybe
			- table 1 repeat but comparison of accept vs refused vs limits
			- table 2 repeat (decision effects)
				- effect of recommendation
				- effect of decision

FIXME:
======

FIXME: 2015-11-27 - [ ] problem with stata connecting via ODBC; seems to hang; for now all prep files drop this and just copied in completed work
FIXME: 2015-11-27 - [ ] problem with waf; seem to need to run it twice for it to work

Log
===

2015-11-27
- now rewriting as per BMJ submission
- maybe introduce the ideas of patient groups to follow as per the rewrite in progress for paper-spotearly

140509
- there are patients in the sample that were admitted to ICU after one week (because they were permitted during the match) but I think my original intention was to match them but then replace their ICU admission time as missing

140506
TRY - drop survival errors early so that you have the same number of patients in the initial analyses as you do in the survival analysis

140506
- Thought about include occupancy of ICU in severity models (at least to show that this _doesn't_ have an effect)? **No** -- leave this out for now: this should go into the survival and delay paper
- converted output of ts_model_count_combine_news.do from xls to csv

140505
- ts_model_ward_severity.do previously called tb_model_ward_severity.do: renamed
- modified ts_model_ward_severity.do so that it writes to a csv file which is then linked to the tables spreadsheet

140413
- added outsheet commands to table files in order that I can generate tables for publication from data
	- table 1a completed
	- table 1b completed
	- supp table 1 - site chars - completed
	- supp table 2 - incidence by news risk class - completed
- replaced all spot_ward references with mas_spotepi (incl those in vcode/spot_ward) so that I don't forget when working in the future with new transfers
- created wr08_sensitivity analysis

140328

- created a single record per patient survival data set by modifying cr_survival
- go back to estimating the median odds ratio; according to this [answer](http://www.stata.com/statalist/archive/2012-11/msg00307.html) it is not possible to derive a confidence interval for this (easily) in stata
- median hazard ratio??
	
	* So to estimate the MHR you now need to
		local twoinvtheta2 = 2 / (e(theta)^2)
	local mhr = exp(sqrt(2*e(theta))*invF(`twoinvtheta2',`twoinvtheta2',0.75))
	di "MHR: `mhr'" 

- produced relative survival estimates using strel2 from LSHTM
- combined all this code into wr06_mortality.do


140324

- added in mortality section wr06_mortality.do
- ts_model_count_news_combine completed but stops before producing latex table and the output goes directly into a spreadsheet for formatting

140318

- re-run tb_model_ward_severity.do: works much better and figure no longer has Ulster as an outlier
- recreated hes_providers table in spot db after correcting the total admissions for Northern Ireland sites in the [original spreadsheet](/Users/steve/analysis/spot_study/data/DoH/140318_IS_HES_Providers_EWNI_compiled_by_hand.xls)
	- this meant re-running import_excel.py, index_table.py, and make_table.py
		- then re-creating the derived tables sites_within_hes and sites_early
	- then running cr_sites.do

140313

- corrected the tb_model_count_news_high model so that days without admissions are included
- corrected sites_early table by re-running make_table.py for

## 140311

- new system for analysis files: use wrXX_ prefix for results paragraphs in paper
- similarly


## 140227

- added back in all cr_* files. These will allow creation of the data set.
- I have not actually re-created all the data via SQL and Python code in /ccode
- source table in SQL is spot_early.working_early - connecting and downloading this table creates `working_raw.dta`
- STROBE diagram data checked and all working up to cr_working.do

These are notes on the analysis to be performed for the spot-epi paper.
The code here will largely come from the code used for spot_ward. In fact, it the directory is a branch published from the spot_ward repo.
For now, I have moved _all_ files into a subfolder called spot_ward so that I have a fresh start. I will then move the relevant files out one-by-one.
