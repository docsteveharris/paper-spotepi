# Abstract

## Background

Identifying and responding to deterioration among ward patients includes early access to critical care. However, critical care provision in the NHS is constrained, and the effects of this on delay to critical care admission, and patient outcomes are poorly understood.

## Methods

We conducted a prospective cohort study of consecutive deteriorating ward patients referred to critical care in `r tt$sites` NHS hospitals (1 November 2010 --- 31 December 2011). We recorded both the assessor's recommendation for critical care, and the decision to admit. Admissions to critical care within one week, and deaths within one year were defined by linking to national registries. Incidence models were stratified by the NHS National Early Warning Score (NEWS) risk class, and used generalised estimating equations. Decision making and survival were modelled with random effects for the hospital using logistic regression and proportional hazards models respectively. 

## Findings

Critical care teams assessed `r tt$patients` patients of whom `r tt$news_high$n` (`r tt$news_high$p`) were in the highest NEWS risk class giving an incidence of 17 NEWS high risk patients (95\%CI 17--18) per hospital per month. `r odys$n[2]` (`r odys$p[2]`) patients were already in established organ failure. Sepsis was reported in `r sepsis$n[2]` (`r sepsis$p[2]`) patients.

`r tt$rxlimits$n[2]` (`r tt$rxlimits$p[2]`) patients with treatment limitation orders were declined critical care. 7-day, 90-day, and 1-year mortalities were `r tt$rxlimits_dead7$p[2]`, `r tt$rxlimits_dead90$p[2]`, and `r tt$rxlimits_dead1y$p[2]` respectively.

Of the remainder, the bedside assessor recommended `r tt$reco$n[2]` (`r tt$reco$p[2]`) to critical care. `r tt$reco_accept$n[2]` (`r tt$reco_accept$p[2]`) were immediately accepted. The median delay between assessment and admission was `r icu.delay$q50` hours (IQR `r icu.delay$iqr`).  Patients over 80 years were less likely to be accepted (OR 0.60 95\%CI 0.53--0.69). Despite adjustment for patient specific risk factors, decision making varied markedly between hospitals (median inter-hospital OR 2.11, 95\%1.81--2.42).

Of the `r tt$reco_accept$n[1]` (`r tt$reco_accept$p[1]`) patients recommended but initially refused, `r tt$reco_late$n[2]` (`r tt$reco_late$p[2]`) were admitted later with a median additional delay of `r delay.by.accept.reco$estimate` hours (IQR `r delay.by.accept.reco$lower`--`r delay.by.accept.reco$upper`). A further `r tt$reco_d7ward$n[2]` (`r  tt$reco_d7ward$p[2]`) patients recommended and refused died without admission.

Excluding patients with treatment limits, 7-day, 90-day, and 1-year mortalities were `r tt$dead7$p[2]`, `r tt$dead90$p[2]`, and `r tt$dead1y$p[2]` respectively. Mortality occurred early with `r tt$dead7.d2$n[2]` of first week deaths (`r tt$dead7.d2$p[2]`) within two days. Survival also varied between hospitals with a median inter-hospital hazard ratio of 1.29 (95%CI, 1.22--1.35).

The critical care unit was full at the time of `r tt$full$n` (`r tt$full$p`) assessments. The patients concerned were less likely to be accepted to critical care (OR 0.72 [95%CI 0.59--0.88]), and less likely to be admitted promptly (OR 0.27 [95%CI 0.19--0.37]). Increasing occupancy was associated with greater physiological deterioration pending admission (p=0.01). We could not exclude an effect of occupancy on 90-day survival (HR 1.07, 95%CI 1.00â€“-1.15).

## Conclusion

Deteriorating ward patients referred to critical care are vulnerable with a high initial mortality. Despite clinical recommendation for admission a substantial minority die without admission. High critical care occupancy both prejudices and delays admission.
