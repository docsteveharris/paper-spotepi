# Abstract

## Background

Recent policy has placed emphasis on identifying and responding to deterioration among ward patients including early access to critical care. However, critical care provision in the NHS is constrained, delay to admission is likely, and patient outcomes poorly understood.

## Methods

We conducted a prospective cohort study of consecutive deteriorating ward patients referred to critical care in `r tt$sites` NHS hospitals (1 November 2010 --- 31 December 2011). We recorded both the assessor's recommendation for critical care, and the decision to admit. For the subsequent week, admission to critical care was defined by linking to the national critical care audit database, and survival to one year by linking to national death registrations. Incidence models were stratified by the NHS National Early Warning Score (NEWS) risk class, and used generalised estimating equations. Decision making and survival were modelled with random effects for the hospital using logistic regression, and Cox proportional hazards respectively. 

## Findings

We included `r tt$patients` patients of whom `r tt$news_high$n` (`r tt$news_high$p`) were in the highest NEWS risk class --- equivalent to 17 high risk patients (95\%CI 17--18) per hospital per month. The critical care unit was full at the time of `r tt$full$n` (`r tt$full$p`) referrals. `r odys$n` (`r odys$p`) patients were in established organ failure with only `r osupp$n` patients (`r osupp$p`) already on organ support. Sepsis was reported in `r sepsis$n` (`r sepsis$p`) patients.

`r tt$rxlimits$n[2]` (`r tt$rxlimits$p[2]`) patients with a treatment limitation order were refused critical care, and were not considered further.  `r tt$reco$n[2]` (`r tt$reco$p[2]`) of the remainder were recommended for critical care of which `r tt$reco_accept$n[2]` (`r tt$reco_accept$p[2]`) were accepted.Patients over 80 years were less likely to be offered admission (OR 0.60 95\%CI 0.53--0.69) as were patients assesssed when the unit was full (OR 0.70, 95\%CI 0.57-0.86).There was also significant interhospital variation in admission decisions (Median OR 2.11, 95\%1.81--2.42).

The remaining `r tt$reco_accept$n[1]` (`r tt$reco_accept$p[1]`) patients recommended were refused immediate admission. Of these, `r t$reco_late$n[2]` (`r reco_late$p[2]`) were admitted later and `r tt$reco_d7ward$n[2]` (`r  tt$reco_d7ward$p[2]`) died in the week following without critical care. The median delay between asssessment and admission was `r icu.delay$q50` hours (IQR `r icu.delay$iqr`) if initially accepted but increased by median `r delay.by.accept$estimate` hours (IQR `r delay.by.accept$lower`--`r delay.by.accept$upper`) for those initially refused.

Referral when the unit was full decreased the odds of being accepted XXX, and the odds of being admitted promptly XXX.



In 13017 (86\%) patients without treatment limits, mortality occured early with 964 (7\%), 1827 (14\%), and 3935 (30\%) deaths at 2, 7, and 90 days respectively. Survival was worse for patients asssessed when the critical care unit was full (HR 1.13, 95\%CI1.00--1.27), and varied between site even after adjustment for patient level risk factors (Median Hazard Ratio 1.28, 95\%CI  1.26--1.30). In the 2141 patients with treatment limits, 90 day mortality was 66\% (1402 deaths).

## Conclusion

Deteriorating ward patients referred to critical care are vulnerable with a high initial mortality. Despite clinical recommendation for admission a substantial minority die without admission, and high critical care occupancy both predujices and delays admission.
