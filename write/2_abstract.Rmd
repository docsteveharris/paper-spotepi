# Abstract

## Background

Recent policy has placed emphasis on identifying and responding to deterioration among ward patients including early access to critical care. However, critical care provision in the NHS is constrained, delay to admission is likely, and patient outcomes poorly understood.

## Methods

We conducted a prospective cohort study of consecutive deteriorating ward patients referred to critical care in `r tt$sites` NHS hospitals (1 November 2010 --- 31 December 2011). We recorded both the assessor's recommendation for critical care, and the decision to admit. Patients were followed for 1 week for critical care use, and for 1 year for survival by linking to national registries. Incidence models were stratified by the NHS National Early Warning Score (NEWS) risk class, and used generalised estimating equations. Decision making and survival were modelled with random effects for the hospital using logistic regression, and proportional hazards respectively. 

## Findings

Critical care teams assessed `r tt$patients` patients of whom `r tt$news_high$n` (`r tt$news_high$p`) were in the highest NEWS risk class giving an incidence of 17 high risk patients (95\%CI 17--18) per hospital per month. `r odys$n[2]` (`r odys$p[2]`) patients were in established organ failure with only `r osupp$n[2]` patients (`r osupp$p[2]`) already on organ support. Sepsis was reported in `r sepsis$n[2]` (`r sepsis$p[2]`) patients. The critical care unit was full at the time of `r tt$full$n` (`r tt$full$p`) assessments. 

`r tt$rxlimits$n[2]` (`r tt$rxlimits$p[2]`) patients with treatment limitation orders were refused critical care with 7-day, 90-day, and 1-year mortalities of `r tt$rxlimits_dead7$p[2]`, `r tt$rxlimits_dead90$p[2]`, and `r tt$rxlimits_dead1y$p[2]` respectively. They were not considered further.

The bedside assessor recommended `r tt$reco$n[2]` (`r tt$reco$p[2]`) of the remainder to critical care of whom `r tt$reco_accept$n[2]` (`r tt$reco_accept$p[2]`) were accepted. The median delay between asssessment and admission was `r icu.delay$q50` hours (IQR `r icu.delay$iqr`).  Patients over 80 years were less likely to be accepted (OR 0.60 95\%CI 0.53--0.69) as were those assesssed when the unit was full (OR 0.70, 95\%CI 0.57-0.86). After adjustment for patient specific risk factors, decision making varied between hospitals (median interhospital OR 2.11, 95\%1.81--2.42).

Of the `r tt$reco_accept$n[1]` (`r tt$reco_accept$p[1]`) patients recommended but initially refused, `r tt$reco_late$n[2]` (`r tt$reco_late$p[2]`) with a median additional delay of `r delay.by.accept$estimate` hours (IQR `r delay.by.accept$lower`--`r delay.by.accept$upper`). `r tt$reco_d7ward$n[2]` (`r  tt$reco_d7ward$p[2]`) recommended and refused died without admission.

Wihthout treatment limits, 7-day, 90-day, and 1-year mortalities were `r tt$dead7$p[2]`, `r tt$dead90$p[2]`, and `r tt$dead1y$p[2]` respectively. Even within the first week, mortality was front-loaded with `r tt$dead7.d2$n[2]` (`r tt$dead7.d2p$[2]`) within two days. Survival also varied between hospitals with a median interhospital hazard ratio of 1.29 (95%CI, 1.22--1.35). Patients assessed when the unit was full did not have different survival in the multi-level model (HR 1.03, 95%CI 0.90–1.17). However, in a single 

if the effect of hospital

Critical care occupancy did not affect survival in the multi-level model (HR 1.03, 95%CI 0.90–1.17 for patients assessed when the critical care was full). A single level model, constructed in case occupancy was mediated rather than confounded by the effect of hospital, similarly could not exclude a null effect (HR 1.07, 95%CI 1.00–1.15).

## Conclusion

Deteriorating ward patients referred to critical care are vulnerable with a high initial mortality. Despite clinical recommendation for admission a substantial minority die without admission, and high critical care occupancy both predujices and delays admission.
