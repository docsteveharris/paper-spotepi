# Discussion

This prospective cohort study describes the events following bedside assessment by critical care of more than 15000 ward patients in 48 acute NHS hospitals. Nearly half (45%) of the patients were defined as being at high risk as per the latest guidelines[@Anonymous:2012un], and one-third (33%) were assessed when the critical care unit was under-strain (two or fewer beds available). One in twelve (8%) were assessed when the unit was completely full. 

The decision making that occured at the bedside assessment was affected by occupancy, but also varied significantly between hospitals after adjustment for measured severity of illness. There was evidence of rationing of critical care in that we observed a bias against admitting the elderly, and saw that decisions to admit were less likely when capacity was limited.

{>>three themes here - inter-hospital variation, occupancy, bias<<}

The consequences of critical care strain, and inter-hospital variation in decision making were two-fold. Firstly, affected patients were less likely to be cared for during their acute illness in critical care, and more likely to die on the ward without a trial of critical care. This was true even for the cohort of patients for whom the bedside assessor thought critical care was justified. Secondly, patients who did receive critical care had their admission delayed - both directly (prompt admission was less likely), and indirectly (by altering the admission pathway to a 'watch-and-wait' strategy with a late rather than a direct admission).

{>>paragraph on mortality, emphasise high rates even in the 'low risk' group<<}

We observed an overall 90-day mortality of 30\%. Even though only a third of these ward patients were admitted to critical care, their mortality is similar to that of unselected critical care admissions.{Harrison2014b; Harrison2007a} This mortality rate is double that of recent inpatient cohorts even though we excluded patients with pre-existing treatment limitation orders.{Clark2014b}

outcomes of more than 12000 ward patients assessed by critical care teams in 48 acute NHS hospitals. We observed an overall 90-day mortality of 30\%. Even though only a third of these ward patients were admitted to critical care, their mortality is similar to that of unselected critical care admissions.{Harrison2014b; Harrison2007a} This mortality rate is double that of recent inpatient cohorts even though we excluded patients with pre-existing treatment limitation orders.{Clark2014b} By the end of a year, two of every five patients assessed had died.
