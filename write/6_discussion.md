We describe the events in the week following bedside assessment by critical care of more than 15000 ward patients in 48 acute NHS hospitals.

Nearly half (45%) of the patients were defined as being at high risk by current guidelines[@Anonymous:2012un], and one-third (33%) were assessed when the critical care unit was under-strain (two or fewer beds available). One in twelve (8%) were assessed when the unit was completely full. 

This strain affected decision making at the bedside, but decision making also varied significantly between hospitals even after adjustment for patient specific risk factors. There was evidence of rationing of critical care in that we observed a bias against admitting the elderly, and saw that decisions to admit were less likely when capacity was limited.

<!-- {>>three themes here - inter-hospital variation, occupancy, bias<<} -->
The consequences of critical care strain, and inter-hospital variation in decision making were two-fold. Firstly, affected patients were less likely to be cared for during their acute illness in critical care, and correspondingly more likely to die on the ward without critical care. This was true even for the cohort of patients for whom the bedside assessor thought critical care was justified. Secondly, patients who did eventually receive critical care had their admission delayed - both directly (prompt admission was simply less likely), and indirectly (by altering the admission pathway to a 'watch-and-wait' strategy with a late rather than a direct admission).

While three-quarters of patients initially accepted to critical care were admitted promptly (within 4-hours), this accounted for only half of those recommended for critical care when assessed. The single most important determinant of a prompt admission was the decision made at the initial assessment, but critical care occupancy was also important both via its effect on that decision making, and in delaying the delivery of that decision.

Among patients without treatment limits, we observed an overall 90-day mortality of 30%. This is comparable to the mortality observed in unselected critical care admissions[@Harrison:2014ei; @Harrison:2007jt]  --- even though only a third of this cohort received critical care. It is also double that of comparable inpatient cohorts.[@Clark:2014hu]

This mortality is heavily front-loaded with around half of deaths in the first week, and half of these in the first 48 hours. This strongly suggests that the opportunity for intervention in these patients is very limited. Importantly, the 7-day mortality was elevated even for patients defined as low risk by NEWS class, and patients, without treatment limits, where the bedside assessor believed just ward care was sufficient. Otherwise said, while the bedside assessment could effectively identify patients at higher risk, it did not define a group where the immediate risk of death, or critical care admission, was reassuringly low.

Hospital level variation remained a significant factor in 90 day survival.

## Strengths and limitations

<!-- STRENGTHS -->
This is the largest prospective study of deteriorating ward patients to date.{>>see research in context<<} The hospitals contributing are representative of the full spectrum of those in the NHS. Most importantly, we have performed follow-up of all patients referred to critical care rather than just the subset of those offered admission.[@OCallaghan:2012da] This permits an examination of the decision making process, and demonstrates that the population referred is at high risk regardless of the outcome of the bedside assessment. 

Our ability to link the precise time of the bedside assessment to the contemporaneous occupancy of the critical care unit allows us to observe the pressures on decision makers, and the effect that limiting resources has on patient pathways. Moreover, because we prospectively captured the raw physiology that define the severity of illness aswell as the bedside recommendation for critical care, we are able to report on the outcomes for the population that either would or should have been admitted were these limits not in play.

## Comparison with other studies

We have included the decision to admit, and prompt delivery of that decision in the final survival model, but neither factor was significantly associated with 90-day survival. Previous studies have frequently reported benefit from prompt admission, but, unlike ours, do not follow the outcomes of patients assessed but not admitted.[@Restrepo:2010ky; @Renaud:2009df; @Cline:2009ed; @Richardson:2009kk; @Chalfin:2007hm;  @Simpson:2005fv; @Young:2003ur; @Parkhe:2002ef; @Rapoport:1990uh] This creates an exclusion bias as the delayed group only contains patients who prove themselves to be on a deteriorating pathway. 

Despite risk adjustment, it is likely that unmeasured end of the bed

## Conclusions and implications for practice and future research

<!-- Conclusion,
- Address, but do not “over-sell”, perceived significance of the study to the field and possible implications for practice/policy
- Ensure conclusions relate directly to the stated a priori hypothesis (and not hypotheses from other studies or outside the area of the study)
- Avoid excessive generalizations of the implications, including unjustified extrapolations beyond the actual population(s) studied
- Remember that except for randomized, controlled trials, there can only be testable hypotheses and observed associations, rather than rigorous proof of cause and effect
- Address areas for improvement with future studies

Aspects of the study stand independent of these limitations. Regardless, of the effect of prompt admission to critical care,

We have identified a cohort of hospital patients at very high risk. This risk is heavily front-loaded, and the window for intervention is short. The bedside assessment is an effective but imperfect triage tool, as the mortality in those initially refused admission is high. Given that we already excluded patients with treatment limitations, it is of concern that nearly half of these early deaths occur without a trial of critical care.

A substantial proportion of patients recommended for critical care are not offered a bed, and this proportion increases when capacity is limited. Expanding critical care bed numbers would first and foremost benefit this group. This is an opportunity to create a virtuous circle. Earlier admission may lead to shorter stays thereby improving flow through critical care as well as outcomes. Identifying those patients who should be admitted promptly is already the top priority for both clinicians and patients.{Reay2014} What we have contributed we hope, is firm evidence in support of this.
