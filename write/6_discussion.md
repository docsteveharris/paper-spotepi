## Main findings

<!-- Discussion,
- Structure the section so that it presents a natural flow of ideas – start with a simple statement of main findings, followed by strengths and limitations of the study, and what the study adds to previous knowledge
- Describe briefly how the results are consistent or not consistent with other similar studies
- Discuss any confounding factors and their impact

This is the largest prospective study of deteriorating ward patients to date.{>>see research in context<<} We describe the events in the week following bedside assessment by critical care of more than 15000 ward patients in 48 acute NHS hospitals.

Nearly half (45%) of the patients were defined as being at high risk as per the latest guidelines[@Anonymous:2012un], and one-third (33%) were assessed when the critical care unit was under-strain (two or fewer beds available). One in twelve (8%) were assessed when the unit was completely full. 

The decision making that occured at the bedside assessment was affected by occupancy, but also varied significantly between hospitals after adjustment for measured severity of illness. There was evidence of rationing of critical care in that we observed a bias against admitting the elderly, and saw that decisions to admit were less likely when capacity was limited.

<!-- {>>three themes here - inter-hospital variation, occupancy, bias<<} -->
The consequences of critical care strain, and inter-hospital variation in decision making were two-fold. Firstly, affected patients were less likely to be cared for during their acute illness in critical care, and correspondingly more likely to die on the ward without critical care. This was true even for the cohort of patients for whom the bedside assessor thought critical care was justified. Secondly, patients who did eventually receive critical care had their admission delayed - both directly (prompt admission was less likely), and indirectly (by altering the admission pathway to a 'watch-and-wait' strategy with a late rather than a direct admission).

Overall, three-quarters of patients initially accepted to critical care were admitted within the 4-hour recommendation but only around a half of those recommended at assement met this guideline. The single most important determinant of a prompt admission was the decision made at the initial assessment, but critical care occupancy was also important both via its effect on that decision making, and in delaying the delivery of that decision.

Among patients without treatment limits, we observed an overall 90-day mortality of 30% for patients without treatment limits. This is comparable to the mortality observed in unselected critical care admissions[@Harrison:2014ei; @Harrison:2007jt]  --- even though only a third of our cohort received critical care. It is also double that of recent inpatient cohorts that included patients with treatment limitations.[@Clark:2014hu]

The mortality burden was heavily front-loaded with around half of deaths in the first week, and half of these in the first 48 hours. This strongly suggests that the opportunity for intervention in these patients is very limited. Importantly, the 7-day mortality burden was elevated even for patients defined as low risk by NEWS class, and for actively treated patients recommended for ward rather than critical care. Otherwise said, while the bedside assessment could effectively identify patients at higher risk, it did not define a group where the immediate risk of death, or critical care admission, was reassuringly low.

Again, hospital level variation, already seen to be part of the decision making process, was also a significant determinant of 90 day survival.

## Comparison with other studies

We have included the decision to admit, and prompt delivery of that decision in the final survival model, but neither factor was significantly associated with 90-day survival. Previous studies have frequently reported benefit from prompt admission, but, unlike ours, do not follow the outcomes of patients assessed but not admitted.[@Restrepo:2010ky; @Renaud:2009df; @Cline:2009ed; @Richardson:2009kk; @Chalfin:2007hm;  @Simpson:2005fv; @Young:2003ur; @Parkhe:2002ef; @Rapoport:1990uh] This creates an exclusion bias as the delayed group only contains patients who prove themselves to be on a deteriorating pathway. 

Despite risk adjustment, it is likely that unmeasured end of the bed

## Conclusions and implications for practice and future research

<!-- Conclusion,
- Address, but do not “over-sell”, perceived significance of the study to the field and possible implications for practice/policy
- Ensure conclusions relate directly to the stated a priori hypothesis (and not hypotheses from other studies or outside the area of the study)
- Avoid excessive generalizations of the implications, including unjustified extrapolations beyond the actual population(s) studied
- Remember that except for randomized, controlled trials, there can only be testable hypotheses and observed associations, rather than rigorous proof of cause and effect
- Address areas for improvement with future studies

Aspects of the study stand independent of these limitations. Regardless, of the effect of prompt admission to critical care,

We have identified a cohort of hospital patients at very high risk. This risk is heavily front-loaded, and the window for intervention is short. The bedside assessment is an effective but imperfect triage tool, as the mortality in those initially refused admission is high. Given that we already excluded patients with treatment limitations, it is of concern that nearly half of these early deaths occur without a trial of critical care.

A substantial proportion of patients recommended for critical care are not offered a bed, and this proportion increases when capacity is limited. Expanding critical care bed numbers would first and foremost benefit this group. This is an opportunity to create a virtuous circle. Earlier admission may lead to shorter stays thereby improving flow through critical care as well as outcomes. Identifying those patients who should be admitted promptly is already the top priority for both clinicians and patients.{Reay2014} What we have contributed we hope, is firm evidence in support of this.
