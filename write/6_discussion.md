# Discussion

We describe the events following initial bedside assessment by critical care of more than 15000 ward patients in 48 acute NHS hospitals. Nearly half (45%) of these patients were defined as being at high risk by current guidelines[@Anonymous:2012un], and one-third (33%) were assessed when the critical care unit was under-strain (two or fewer beds available). One in twelve (8%) were assessed when the unit was completely full. 

Critical care capacity affected the decision to admit, and subsequent patient pathways. Moreover, the decision making varied between hospitals. Bias against admitting the elderly provided additional evidence of rationing.

The consequences of critical care strain, and inter-hospital variation in decision making were two-fold. Firstly, affected patients had their admission delayed either directly (delayed immediate critical care), or indirectly (declined immediate admission before late reversal of the initial decision). Secondly, patients were simply less likely to ever be cared for critical care during the week following assessment. Correspondingly, they were more likely to die on the ward without critical care. This was true even for the cohort of patients for whom the bedside assessor thought critical care was justified.

Despite an immediate decision to admit, one-quarter of patients were still not admitted within the fours hours recommended. Compared to the international literature this four hour target is not strict.[@Stelfox:2012iy; @Robert:2012ep] 

The mortality rate in these patients is high. Around one in three patients assessed die within 90-days, and nearly one half do not survive a year. In fact, the mortality is not dissimilar to that seen in the unselected critical care population even though only a mintority of these ward patients were admitted.[@Harrison:2014ei; @Harrison:2007jt]

Importantly, early (7-day) mortality is still elevated either for patients defined as objectively low risk by NEWS class, or subjectively low risk by the bedside assessor. In other words, mere referral for ward assessment by critical care is already effectively identifying a high risk population. This risk is heavily front-loaded with around half of deaths in the first week, and half of those deaths in the first 48 hours. This implies that the time window for successful intervention has either passed, or is narrow.

Hospital level variation is a significant factor. We could not show a direct effect of occupancy on mortality in this model. However, if part of the effect of being in a 'good' hospital is mediated through how critical care occupancy is managed then this difference would have been inappropriately 'adjusted away'. In our single level model, the effect of occupancy on mortality was greater; thus we cannot confidently exclude occupancy as having a clinically important effect. The observation that, as critical care capacity becomes more constrained, those patients eventually admitted both waited longer, and  deteriorated further, would be consistent with this hypothesis. 

Finally, although referrals for assessment by critical care were more frequent during winter, the weekend, and out-of-hours, there was no independent decrease in risk adjusted survival in these groups.

## Comparison with other studies

There are no similar studies of ward patients referred to critical care in the UK. However it would appear that the incidence of referrals we report is much lower than in similar health care systems. We observed around 8 unselected referrals per 1,000 inpatient admissions whereas others report in the range of 25--50.[@Jones:2011gy; @Buist:2007oq; @Bell:2006gr; @Simchen:2004vf] 

Despite our smaller and presumably more selected population, the mortality we observe is similar --- although direct comparisons remain difficult because the reporting metrics differ (hospital mortality versus 30-day survival). For additional context, it is worth comparing the overall 61% one year survival for the ward patients referred to critical care to that for UK patients diagnosed with lung (30%), colorectal (75%) and breast cancer (95%).[@Coleman:2011ip]

Finally, while critical care occupancy rates in the UK vastly exceed those seen in a recent report from the US Veteran's Affairs hospitals, they are not dissimilar to those in France or Canada.[@Chen:2012hu; @Stelfox:2012iy; @Robert:2012ep] However, since our delay to admission is markedly worse than these studies (between 1 and 5 hours for direct and indirect admissions versus 2 and 12 hours in this study), it is possible that the consequences of occupancy also vary. Delayed discharges because of lack of inpatient ward capacity are increasingly common in the NHS, and present a more significant impediment to ICU admission than a unit that chooses to defer discharge until the need arises but has no problem doing so when required.

## Strengths and limitations

This is the largest prospective study of deteriorating ward patients to date. The hospitals contributing are representative of the full spectrum of those in the NHS. Most importantly, we have followed up all patients referred to critical care rather than just the subset offered admission.[@OCallaghan:2012da] 

This 'denominator' data allows us to examine the demand for critical care arising from inpatient work. Critical care is normally judged based on the patients it admits, but here we can see the wider context, and the ongoing triage of an at-risk population. Crucially, follow-up of all patients assessed generates the control group that enables us to understand the consequences of this triage process. With two notable exceptions[@Stelfox:2012iy; @Robert:2012ep], most studies of ward patients referred to critical care only follow those eventually admitted. Evaluations of decision making are therefore limited to early versus late admission, and suffer from survival and exclusion bias. They cannot report on patients who die without critical care admission, or survive despite initial refusal. Our work demonstrates that such patients are numerous. In fact in the first week, even after excluding patients with treatment limits, most deaths occur on the ward without critical care.

An additional strength has been our ability to link the precise time of the bedside assessment to the contemporaneous occupancy of the critical care unit. This has allowed us to observe the pressures on decision makers, and the effect that limiting resources has on patient pathways.

Finally, we have completed follow-up to one year. While mortality is substantial, it is predominantly an early problem thereby supporting the concept of early intervention. In particular, our observation that one in four patients with a treatment limitation orders survive a year without critical care suggests a need for humility before refusing early intervention on the grounds of long term prognosis.

Some limitations also deserve highlighting. Firstly, we have used real time data collection in order to capture assessments and decisions. Despite limiting the data request, not all hospitals managed to submit complete data at all times.We used the proportion of emergency ward admissions in the CMP successfully linked to the (SPOT)light database to define completeness. Reassuringly, we tested our findings by raising the threshold for judging data capture to 90% so that the median proportion of eligible admissions was 97%. We found no consistent difference in any result other than a fall in precision as the quality threshold increased, and the sample size inevitably fell.

The second weakness is structural rather than operational, and is that, in defining our population as those referred, we are blind to the process that leads to that referral. The literature typically names the ward monitoring process leading to referral as the afferent limb, and response of critical care to that referral as the efferent limb of a rapid response system. There is clearly both an unobserved period of deterioration prior to referral for patients in the study, and an unobserved population that might have been referred. Both these afferent components are as valid targets for intervention, as the observed efferent components of the pathway that we have discussed. However, observing the wider group of potential referrals would require a much briefer, narrower study.[@Simchen:2007bn]


## Conclusions and implications for practice and future research
<!-- Conclusion,
- Address, but do not “over-sell”, perceived significance of the study to the field and possible implications for practice/policy
- Ensure conclusions relate directly to the stated a priori hypothesis (and not hypotheses from other studies or outside the area of the study)
- Avoid excessive generalizations of the implications, including unjustified extrapolations beyond the actual population(s) studied
- Remember that except for randomized, controlled trials, there can only be testable hypotheses and observed associations, rather than rigorous proof of cause and effect
- Address areas for improvement with future studies

Aspects of the study stand in spite of these limitations. Ward patients referred to critical care numerous, and vulnerable. The opportunity for intervention is brief, and there is important variation in practice between hospitals. The bedside assessment is an effective but imperfect triage tool, as the mortality in those initially declined admission is high. Given that we already excluded patients with treatment limitations, it is of concern that around half of these early deaths occur without a trial of critical care.

A substantial proportion of patients assessed and recommended for critical care are not offered a bed, and this proportion increases when capacity is limited. Expanding critical care bed numbers would first and foremost benefit this group. However, it might also create a virtuous circle. Earlier admission may lead to shorter stays thereby improving flow through critical care as well as outcomes. Identifying those patients who should be admitted promptly is already the top priority for both clinicians and patients.[@Reay:2014vm] What we have contributed we hope, is firm evidence in support of this.

This delivery of prompt critical care depends on a chain of events: the hospital must have the appropriate infrastructure; the acute illness must occur when there is critical care capacity; the bedside assessor must recognise the imminent risk to the patient; and, finally the critical care gatekeeper must act on the recommendation. 
In our model, the most important of these events was that final decision to admit although the decision d
