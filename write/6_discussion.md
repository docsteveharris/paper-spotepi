## Key findings

We describe the events following initial bedside assessment by critical care of more than 15000 ward patients in 48 acute NHS hospitals. Nearly half (45%) of these patients were defined as being at high risk by current guidelines{Anonymous:2012un}. A third (33%) were assessed while the critical care unit was under-strain (two or fewer beds available), and 1 in 12 (8%) were assessed when the unit was completely full.

Critical care capacity affected bedside decision-making, and, despite adjustment for patient specific risk factors, the threshold for admission varied between hospitals, and across age groups. As a consequence, affected patients were less likely to be admitted to critical care, and more likely to die on the ward without critical care. This was true regardless of the recommendation made by the bedside assessor. Those who were admitted either had that admission delayed directly (delayed immediate critical care), or indirectly (later reversal of an initial refusal). Even for those immediately offered a bed, one in four were delayed more than four hours. Compared to the international literature this four hour target is not strict.[@Stelfox:2012iy; @Robert:2012ep] 

The mortality rate for all patients assessed was high, and not dissimilar to that for critical care inpatients although only a minority were admitted.[@Harrison:2014ei; @Harrison:2007jt] Around one in three patients died within 90-days, and nearly one half did not survive a year. Early (7-day) mortality is elevated even for low risk patients whether that risk is defined objectively by NEWS class, or subjectively by the bedside assessor. This risk is heavily front-loaded with around half of deaths in the first week, and half of those deaths in the first 48 hours implying that the opportunity for intervening is narrow. We did not observe a weekend or out-of-hours effect on risk adjusted survival.

We could not show a direct effect of occupancy on mortality in our primary analysis. However, we adjusted for hospital, and, if part of the effect of being in a 'good' hospital is mediated through how critical care occupancy is managed, then this difference would have been inappropriately 'adjusted away'. In our single level model, the effect of occupancy on mortality was greater; thus we cannot confidently exclude occupancy as having a clinically important effect. Notably, we did observe significant changes in process measures (delay to admission, and physiological deterioration while waiting) that would be consistent with this hypothesis.

## Strengths and limitations

This is the largest prospective study of deteriorating ward patients to date, with hospitals contributing from across the spectrum of the NHS. There are three main strengths. Firstly, we followed all patients referred not just those eventually admitted. This 'denominator' data exposes the demand for critical care arising from inpatient wards, and the ongoing process of triage performed by all critical care teams. With two notable exceptions[@Stelfox:2012iy; @Robert:2012ep], similar studies only follow those eventually admitted.[@OCallaghan:2012da; @Restrepo:2010ky; @Renaud:2009df; @Chalfin:2007hm; @Simpson:2005fv] Evaluations of decision making without sight of those referred and refused cannot report on patients who die without critical care admission, or survive despite initial refusal: survival and exclusion bias respectively.
We demonstrate that such patients are numerous: most deaths in the first week occur on the ward --- even amongst those without treatment limitations.

Secondly, we linked the precise time of the bedside assessment to the contemporaneous occupancy of the critical care unit, and to reveal the effect of resource limitation on patient pathways. Thirdly, we completed follow-up to one year. While the main message is that mortality is an early problem, and that interventions must be timely, we also note that one in four patients with a treatment limitation orders survive a full year without critical care. This suggests a need for humility before refusing admission on the grounds of long term prognosis.

Some limitations also deserve highlighting. We used real time data collection in order to capture assessments and decisions, and consequently, not all hospitals managed to submit complete data at all times. However, we used the proportion of emergency ward admissions in the CMP successfully linked to the (SPOT)light database as a metric to track completeness, and tested our findings by varying this threshold. Raising the minimum standard from 80% to 90% increased the median proportion of eligible admissions from 93% to 97% without consistent difference in any result other than a fall in precision as the sample size was reduced.

The second weakness is structural rather than operational. In defining our population as those referred, we were blind to the process that leads to referral (commonly known as the afferent limb of the critical care response).[@Jones:2011gy] There exists both an unobserved population of potential referrals, and an unobserved period of deterioration prior to the actual referral. While these are valid targets for intervention, observation would require a briefer, narrower, and less generalisable study design.[@Simchen:2007bn]

## Comparison with other studies

There are no similar studies of ward patients referred to critical care in the UK. However it would appear that the incidence of referrals we report is much lower than in other comparable health care systems (around 8 versus 25--50 referrals per 1,000 inpatient admissions).[@Jones:2011gy; @Buist:2007oq; @Bell:2006gr; @Simchen:2004vf] Despite our smaller and presumably more selected population, we observe a similar  mortality --- although direct comparisons remain difficult because the reporting metrics differ (hospital mortality versus 30-day survival). For additional context, it is worth comparing the overall 61% one year survival for the ward patients referred to critical care to that for UK patients diagnosed with lung (30%), colorectal (75%) and breast cancer (95%).[@Coleman:2011ip]

With respect to occupancy, the rates we observe vastly exceed those seen in US Veteran's Affairs hospitals, but are not dissimilar to those in France or Canada.[@Chen:2012hu; @Stelfox:2012iy; @Robert:2012ep] However, the delays to admission in this study are markedly worse (2 and 12 hours versus 1 and 5 hours for direct and indirect admissions respectively). National audit data suggests that delayed ICU discharges for study hospitals are increasing[@Anonymous:2016ub], and we also know that hospital inpatient capacity in the UK is constrained.[@Wunsch:2008kk] Blocked discharges from the ICU to the ward that in turn delay new admissions might well be expected to cause such intransigent delays.

## Conclusions and implications for practice and future research

We conclude that ward patients referred to critical care are numerous, and vulnerable. The opportunity for intervention is brief, and there is important variation in practice between hospitals. The bedside assessment is an effective but imperfect triage tool, as the mortality even in those not recommended for admission is high. Given that we already excluded patients with treatment limitations, it is of concern that around half of these early deaths occur without a trial of critical care.

A substantial proportion of patients assessed and recommended for critical care are not offered a bed, and these refusals increase when capacity is limited. Expanding critical care bed numbers would first and foremost benefit this group. However, it might also create a virtuous circle. Earlier admission may lead to shorter stays thereby improving flow through critical care as well as outcomes. Identifying those patients who should be admitted promptly is already the top priority for both clinicians and patients.[@Reay:2014vm] What we have contributed we hope, is firm evidence in support of this.
