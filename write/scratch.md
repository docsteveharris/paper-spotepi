## Objectives 

To describe the impact of delayed or refused critical care admission on outcomes of deteriorating ward patients

## Design 

Prospective observational cohort study

## Setting 

48 NHS hospitals

## Participants

15158 adult ward patients referred to, and assessed by, critical care during 2010-11

## Main outcome measures 

Provision and timeliness of critical care, and mortality up to one year

## Results 

Of 15158 ward patients assessed, 5164 (34%) were already in organ failure, with 870 in receipt of organ support. 6759 (45%) were in the highest National Early Warning Score (NEWS) risk class giving an incidence of 17 high-risk referrals per hospital per month. 

2141 (14%) patients with treatment limitation orders were declined critical care. Of the 13017 patients without treatment limits, 4976 (38%) were recommended for critical care, and 3375 (68%) were immediately offered admission (median time to admission 2 hours, IQR 1 to 4). The 1601 (32%) patients recommended for, but not immediately offered, critical care comprised 1021 (64%) who were admitted later  (median time 12 hours, IQR 5 to 29), and 179 (11%) patients who died without admission. Decision-making varied by patient subgroup (OR 0.60; 95%CI 0.53 to 0.69 for immediate admission if â‰¥80 years), and by hospital (median inter-hospital OR 2.11, 95%CI 1.81 to 2.42). For patients without treatment limits, 7-day, 90-day, and 1-year mortalities were 14%, 30%, and 39%, respectively. Survival varied between hospitals, even after adjustment for patient-specific risks (median inter-hospital hazard ratio 1.29, 95%CI 1.22-1.35).

1198 (8%) patients were assessed when critical care unit was full. They were less likely to be offered admission  (OR 0.72, 95%CI 0.59 to 0.88), or to be admitted promptly (OR 0.27, 95%CI 0.19 to 0.37). Increased critical care  occupancy was associated with greater physiological deterioration pending admission (p=0.01). An effect of occupancy on 90-day survival could not be excluded (HR 1.07, 95%CI 1.00 to 1.15).

## Conclusions 

Deteriorating ward patients referred to critical care have a high mortality. Despite clinical recommendation for admission, a substantial minority die or deteriorate pending admission partly related to high critical care occupancy.
