# Abstract

## Background

Recent policy has placed emphasis on identifying and responding to deterioration among ward patients including early access to critical care. However, critical care provision in the NHS is constrained, delay to admission is likely, and patient outcomes poorly understood.

## Methods

We conducted a prospective cohort study of consecutive deteriorating ward patients assessed by critical care in 48 NHS hospitals (1 November 2010 — 31 December 2011). We recorded the bedside recommendation for critical care, the initial decision to admit, and contemporaneous critical care occupancy. Patients were followed for 1 week for possible critical care admission, and for 1 year for survival by linking to national registries. Incidence models were stratified by the NHS National Early Warning Score (NEWS) risk class, and used generalised estimating equations. For patients without treatment limits, we built logistic models for the decision to admit and prompt admission (within 4 hours), and proportional hazards models for 90-day survival. We included random effects for hospitals, and reported interhospital variation as the median odds/hazard ratio (MOR/MHR) observed when comparing patients across all pairwise combinations of hospitals.

## Findings

Critical care teams assessed 15158 patients including 6759 (45%) in the NEWS high risk category. A typical hospital would see 17 high risk patients (95%CI 17–18) per hospital per month. 5164 (34%) patients were in established organ failure but only 870 (6%) patients were already receiving organ support. Sepsis was reported in 9296 (61%) patients. 2141 (14%) patients were refused critical care with a treatment limitation order of which 506 (24%) nonetheless survived to one year. The critical care unit was full at the time of 1198 (8%) assessments. 

3546 (27%) patients were initally accepted to critical care with a 7-day mortality of 20% (725 deaths) compared to 12% (1102 deaths) for the 9471 (62%) refused without treatment limits. Elderly patients were less likely to be accepted (≥80 years: odds ratio (OR) 0.51, 95% confidence interval 0.43 to 0.60) as were patients referred when the unit was full (OR 0.72, 0.59 to 0.88). Decision-making varied significantly between hospitals (MOR 2.11, 95% confidence interval 1.81 to 2.42).

<!-- discuss patients refused -->
The initial refusal was reversed in 1745 (18%) patients, but a further 799 (8%) died on the ward without critical care. 1601 (17%) of those refused had been assessed as requiring critical care of whom 580 (36%) were admitted later, and 179 (11%) died without critical care.
<!-- discuss delay -->
The median delay to admission was 2 hours (IQR 1–-4) if initially accepted, and 12 hours (IQR 5--29) if initially refused. Prompt admission was less likely when the unit was full (odds ratio 0.27, 0.19 to 0.37), and again varied between sites (MOR 1.89, 1.63 to 2.21).

90-day mortality was 30% (3935) for patients without treatment limits, and most deaths occurred early (25% within 3 days, and 50% within 9 days). Mortality was higher for those recommended to critical care, 



but 25%

Without treatment limits, 90-day mortality was 30% (3935 deaths), but nearly half (46%, 1827 deaths) occurred in the first 7-days of which 841 (46%)occurred on the ward without critical care. 

The critical care unit was full at the time of 1198 (8%) assessments. Such patients were less likely to be accepted (OR 0.72 [95%CI 0.59--0.88]), and less likely to be admitted promptly (within 4 hours) (OR 0.27 [95%CI 0.19–0.37]). 90-day survival was not worse for these patients either in a multi-level (HR 1.03, 95%CI 0.90–1.17), or single level (HR 1.07, 95%CI 1.00–1.15) model. The latter was constructed in case the effect of hospital on survival was mediated rather than confounded by strain on critical care capacity. However, even after adjustment for patient risk factors, there was significant variation in survival rates between hospitals (MHR 1.28, 95%CI 1.26–1.30).

## Conclusion

Deteriorating ward patients referred to critical care are vulnerable with a high initial mortality. A substantial minority are either admitted late to, or die without, critical care, and critical care occupancy both predujices and delays admission.
