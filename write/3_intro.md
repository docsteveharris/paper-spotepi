# Introduction

Around 200 acute hospitals in England that care for more than 11 million overnight hospital admissions per annum. Each patient spends an average of 5 days on a hospital ward where they undergo a process of continual triage, and those who deteriorate are referred to critical care.{Anonymous:tc} This interface between the ward and critical care has been a priority area for the English National Health Service (NHS), but available data derive from qualitative work, small retrospective studies, or voluntary reporting systems [@Luettel:2007va; @McQuillan:1998uj; @Cullinane:2005vg].

Recent international reports suggest that critical care capacity can affect decision making for these patients.[@Chen:2012hu; @Stelfox:2012iy; @Robert:2012ep] The last significant funding increase for critical care in the NHS was in 2000, and, in 2010, the United Kingdom (UK) was still ranked 24 out of 28 European countries in terms of critical care provision.[@Rhodes:2012kb] Similar results are found when for comparisons with North American health care.[@Wunsch:2008kk] This implies that access to critical care in England may be relatively constrained, and that more referrals may be delayed or refused.

These constraints will particularly affect ward patients referred to critical care that already suffer an inpatient mortality two to three times higher than average.[@Simchen:2007bn; @Buist:2002kc; @Clark:2014hu]

We set out to investigate the impact of, and circumstances surrounding delays in admission to critical care. Previous studies have typically limited themselves to comparisons of early versus late admissions, and have excluded by design those never admitted. This introduces survivorship bias (those who die before late admission), and an exclusion bias (those who survive without admission). Instead, we have prospectively followed all patients referred to critical care, traced subsequent critical care admission in the week after referral (the 'efferent limb' of a rapid response system), and performed survival follow-up to one-year.
