# Introduction

There are more than 160 acute hospitals in England that care for more than 11 million overnight hospital admissions per annum. Each patient spends a mean of 5 days on a hospital ward where they undergo a process of continual triage, and those who deteriorate are referred to critical care.[@Anonymous:tc] This interface between the ward and critical care has been a priority area for the English National Health Service (NHS), but available data derive from qualitative work, small retrospective studies, or voluntary reporting systems [@Luettel:2007va; @McQuillan:1998uj; @Cullinane:2005vg].

Recent international reports suggest that critical care capacity affects decision making for these patients.[@Chen:2012hu; @Stelfox:2012iy; @Robert:2012ep] The last significant funding increase for critical care in the NHS was in 2000, and in 2010 the United Kingdom (UK) was still ranked 24 out of 28 European countries in terms of critical care provision.[@Rhodes:2012kb] Similar results are found when the comparison is with North American health care systems.[@Wunsch:2008kk] This implies that access to critical care here will be correspondingly constrained, and admissions may be delayed or refused.

Ward patients affected by this are likely to be among the most vulnerable in the hospital. Hospital mortality for these patients is probably two to three times the 9% overall inpatient mortality recently reported in Scottish NHS hospitals.[@Simchen:2007bn; @Buist:2002kc; @Clark:2014hu] 

We set out to investigate the severity of, and circumstances surrounding delay to admission to critical care. Previous studies typically limit themselves to comparisons of early versus late admissions, and exclude by design those never admitted. This introduces a survivor bias (those who die before late admission), and an exclusion bias (those who survive without admission). We have instead prospectively followed all patients referred to critical care, traced any admission within the first week after referral (the 'efferent limb' of a rapid response system), and performed survival follow-up to one-year.
