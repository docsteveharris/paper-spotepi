# Introduction

There are more than 160 acute hospitals in England that care for more than 11 million overnight hospital admissions per annum. Each patient spends a mean of 5 days on a hospital ward.[Centre, 2012, \#17089] These inpatients undergo a process of continual triage, and those who deteriorate are referred to critical care. This interface between the ward and critical care has been a priority area for the English National Health Service (NHS), but available data derive from qualitative work such as the NHS National Patient Safety Agency report[Luettel et al., 2007, \#734], relatively small retrospective studies[McQuillan et al., 1998, \#605], or voluntary reporting systems[Cullinane et al., 2005, \#15159]. 

International reports indicate that episodes of deterioration are common, and have poor outcome. Inpatient referrals to critical care outreach teams (CCOT), or their equivalent, appear to run between 25--50 per 1,000 hospital admissions.[Bell et al., 2006, \#17133; Buist et al., 2007, \#17325; Jones et al., 2009, \#17139] For such patients, hospital mortality rates are reported as 26% (Australia), and 30-day mortality as 28% (Israel).[Buist et al., 2007, \#17325; Simchen et al., 2004, \#705] This greatly exceeds the 8Â·9% inpatient 30-day mortality recently reported in Scottish NHS hospitals.[Clark et al., 2014, \#86524] 

Critical care provision in the NHS is constrained despite a one-third increase in funding for beds in 2000. In 2010, the United Kingdom (UK) was ranked 24 out of 28 European countries in terms of provision of critical care beds per capita population.[Rhodes et al., 2012, \#15692] Similar results are found when the comparison is with North American health care systems.[Wunsch et al., 2008, \#761] This ought to imply that access to critical care for the deteriorating ward patient is correspondingly constrained, and that delay to admission to critical care is a problem. 

We set out to measure the incidence, the disposition, and the outcome of the deteriorating ward patient referred to critical care, and the factors affecting the decision making around, and the timing of, admission.
