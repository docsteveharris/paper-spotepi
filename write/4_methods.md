## Study design and participants

The (SPOT)light study was a prospective observational cohort study of the deteriorating ward patient referred for ward assessment by critical care. The physiological status of the patient at the time of the first bedside assessment by critical care was prospectively recorded along with the recommendation made at the end of the assessment. By linking the records generated at the time of the bedside assessment, to records in the Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre's Case Mix Programme database (ICNARC CMPD), the fact and timing of admission to critical care were identified. By linking to the NHS Information Service then survival status up to one year was obtained. 

Patients were eligible if they were inpatients on general hospital wards who had been referred to, and assessed by, critical care. The ward assessment had to be performed at the bedside by a member of the critical care team. This team was defined broadly to include members of the critical care outreach team (CCOT), or members of the critical care medical or nursing staff. Only the first ward assessment for a given episode of illness was eligible; cardiac arrests, planned critical care admissions, and visits by the team solely for the purpose of retrieving a patient (where a decision to admit had already been made) were excluded. 

Demographic information, the date, time and location of the visit, and the level of care at the time of the visit were recorded.[@Eddleston:2009wy] Patient physiology (vital signs, arterial blood gas and laboratory measurements) at the time of, or immediately preceding, the ward assessment was abstracted along with organ support, antibiotic therapy, and a subjective assessment of the likelihood of sepsis, and its source. The assessor finally reported the level of care he or she recommended, and the actual outcome of that recommendation at the initial assessment (immediate admission or ongoing ward care). Treatment limitation orders were recorded for those declined. 

## Procedures

The study was registered on the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Clinical Research Network portfolio, and only hospitals participating in the CMP were eligible. Research teams at each hospital attended a Dataset Familiarization Course, and a data collection manual (containing definitions of items to be collected) was provided. The Clinical Trials Unit at ICNARC co-ordinated and provided support for research queries during the study.

Hospitals were asked to report all consecutive ward referrals to the critical care team. Contemporaneous data collection was promoted, but hospitals were also requested to identify and submit any missed referrals. Reporting was via a secure online web portal which performed real-time field and record level validation. Further on-line validation reports were completed by all hospitals before the database was locked in September 2012. Fact and date of death were then requested from the NHS Information Service. CCOT provision was reported by participating hospitals, and contemporaneous CMP data and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) were used to define critical care provision, occupancy, and hospital characteristics. To inform completeness of capture of ward referrals and to quality control the study, we used the proportion of emergency ward admissions in the CMP successfully linked to the (SPOT)light database. Data quality was judged on a monthly basis, and only those months were linkage exceeded 80% were included.

## Statistical analysis

Survival was evaluated at 90-days. Sample size was calculated to evaluate mortality increases from delay to admission using estimates from 2007 ICNARC CMP data. The target sample size was 12,075--20,125 patients referred to critical care which allowed for delay to admission to occur in 10--40% of referrals and for mortality effect sizes between 5--10%. 

From the physiology measurements at ward assessment, the ICNARC physiology score, the NHS National Early Warning Score (NEWS) and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score were calculated with missing values given zero weights as recommended.[@Anonymous:2012un; @Harrison:2007jt; @Vincent:1996vs] The NEWS score can be used to define three risk classes (Low, Medium, and High) designed to trigger an escalating clinical response.

Prompt admission to critical care was defined as one occuring within four hours of ward assessment.[@Anonymous:2013up]

The indicator of critical care unit occupancy was the difference between the maximum number of beds reported to ICNARC, and the number of actively treated patients occupying those beds at the time the ward patient was assessed. Bed pressure (occupancy) was defined as being high (zero or fewer beds available), medium (one or two beds available), or low (three or more beds available).

Incidence models were stratified by NEWS risk class. The unit of analysis was a study day so that daily fluctuations in lagged critical care occupancy could be examined. Estimation was via generalised estimating equations (GEE) with each hospital as a cluster, and day-by-day correlations modelled using a first order auto-regressive structure. Decision to admit to critical care, and promptness of admission, were modelled using multi-level logistic regression with patients nested within hospitals. Cox proportional hazards were used to model survival with a shared frailty factor for hospitals. The proportional hazards assumption was checked by inspecting plots of smoothed exponentiated standardised SchoÃ«nfeld residuals, and re-entering terms using time-varying co-efficients where necessary. Random effects are reported using the Median Odds Ratio (MOR), and the Median Hazard Ratio (MHR) using the bootstrap to generate 95% confidence intervals. These statistics represent the median difference when comparing patient outcomes from any two randomly selected hospitals.[@Bengtsson:2010ib]

Categorical data were reported as counts and percentages, and continuous data as mean (SD) or median (IQR) values. Effect measures are reported with their 95% confidence intervals.

## Role of the funding source

The study was centrally funded by the Wellcome Trust, sponsored by ICNARC, and supported at NHS hospitals through the NIHR service support costs. The funders of the study had no role in the study design; data gathering, analysis, and interpretation; writing of the report; and decision to submit for publication. The corresponding author had full access to all the data (including statistical reports and tables), takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and accuracy of the data analysis, and takes final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.
