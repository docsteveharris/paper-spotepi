Dear Editor,

We have pleasure in submitting our manuscript entitled "Provision of critical care, and impact on mortality for deteriorating ward patients: a prospective observational cohort study in 48 NHS hospitals" for your consideration.

This is the largest prospective observational study of deteriorating ward patients referred to critical care to date. We show that these vulnerable patients are often admitted late, or refused admission. One in twelve patients are referred when the critical care unit is already full, which negatively impacts on provision and timeliness of critical care, and patient physiology. Moreover, there is significant variation between hospitals even after adjustment for occupancy and patient specific risk factors. 

With the NHS firmly in the spotlight, we believe our study results will be particularly timely to fuel the debate about healthcare spending and resource utilization.

Sincerely

Steve Harris

Additional notes

Please note 

- This work has been presented (and won awards) at the UK and European Intensive Care Society Meetings in 2014
- We would respectfully suggest the following people to help with peer review
    + Professor Nick Black, nick.black@lshtm.ac.uk
    + Dr Nazir Lone, nazir.lone@ed.ac.uk
    + Professor Richard Grieve, Richard.Grieve@lshtm.ac.uk
- We realise that the paper exceeds the recommended word count (4403 versus 4000 words). We considered removing the discussion of incidence but retained this on the basis that it was one of the endpoints of the original study protocol. We would be happy to move this to the supplemental material if needed.
