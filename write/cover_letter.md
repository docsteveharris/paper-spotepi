Dear Editor,

We have pleasure in submitting our manuscript entitled "Provision of critical care for deteriorating ward patients, and impact on mortality: a prospective observational cohort study in 48 NHS hospitals" for your consideration.

This is the largest prospective observational study of deteriorating ward patients referred to critical care to date. We show that these vulnerable patients are often admitted late, or refused admission. One in twelve patients are referred when the critical care unit is already full, which negatively impacts on provision and timeliness of critical care, and patient physiology. Moreover, there is significant variation between hospitals even after adjustment for occupancy and patient specific risk factors. 

With an the NHS firmly in the spotlight, we believe our study results will be particularly timely to fuel the debate about healthcare spending and resource utilization.

> We realise that the paper exceeds the recommended word count. We have included an extensive discussion about the biases in a non-randomised evaluation of critical care alongside the instrumental variable analysis. Whilst we believe this is important, if the paper needed shortening, then the description of decision making and outcomes for NHS ward patients, when critical care is under strain do stand independently.

- [X] Details of any previous publication of the same study in electronic form. For example, The BM does not consider posting of protocols and results in clinical trials registries to be prior publication, but we would like to know if results have been posted, and where (please provide URLs or trial registration details). And we are pleased to consider articles based on longer systematic reviews and meta-analyses published at the Cochrane Library or HTA database.
