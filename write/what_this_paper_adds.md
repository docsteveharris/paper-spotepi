# What this paper adds #

## What is already known on this topic ##

- Critical care provision in the UK is limited in comparison to health care systems in Europe and North America.
- Deteriorating patient pathways, the interface between the ward and critical care, have been a priority area for the National Health Service (NHS) since 2005 but existing data comes comes from small retrospective studies or voluntary reporting systems.

## What this study adds ##

- Ward patients assessed by critical care are immediately vulnerable:  a third are in established organ failure, and 14% die within a week, even excluding those with treatment limits.
- Although a third (35%) of patients assessed are recommended critical care, 37% of these are not offered a bed, and delays to admission commonly exceed national guidelines
- One in twelve patients (8%) are assessed when the unit is already full: these patients are less likely to be offered critical care or admitted promptly, and are more likely to deteriorate pending admission.
- Bedside decision making for deteriorating patients is imperfect, and compromised by current critical care provision.
