48 hospitals reported 20893 visits over 435 months. 2694 visits (12.9%)
did not meet the inclusion criteria including 1860 (8.9%) repeat visits,
and 586 (2.8%) patients recently discharged from critical care. Data
linkage was incomplete (&lt; 80%) for 66 (15%) study-months excluding a
further 2440 (11.7%) visits. Therefore 15759 patients were recruited to
the study, of which 15158 (96.1%) completed follow-up without error and
were available for analysis (Figure 1). Final data linkage (ward visits
to critical care admissions) was 93% complete.

Participating hospitals
-----------------------

The participating hospitals comprised 10 teaching and 38 general
hospitals that each collected data between September 2010 and December
2011 for a median of 8 months (IQR 5 to 9 months). Each hospital
contributed a median of 252 patients (IQR 162 to 380). Critical Care
Outreach Teams (CCOT) operated 24 hours/day and 7 days/week in 14 (29%)
hospitals, less than 24 hours/day in 19 (40%) hospitals, and less than 7
days/week in 13 (27%) hospitals. Two hospitals had no CCOT.

There was a median of 12 (IQR 9 to 18) critical care beds per hospital
(mixed Level 2 \[typically intensive monitoring or single organ
support\], and Level 3 \[ventilated or multiple organ support\]), most
often co-located in a single physical location (45 hospitals).

Bed pressure was high (zero or fewer beds) for 1198 (8%) assessments,
medium (one or two beds available) for 3757 (25%) assessments, and low
(three or more beds available) for the remaining 10197 (67%)
assessments. Critical care occupancy fluctuated with time of the day,
day of the week, and season of the year (supplementary Figure 1).

Incidence of critical care referrals
------------------------------------

We estimated the mean baseline (non-teaching hospital with 60,000
admissions per year and 24/7 CCOT provision) incidence of referrals to
critical care at 46 (95% confidence interval 50 to 54) patients per
month of which 17 (95%CI 17 to 18) patients met the NEWS high risk
criteria at assessment. This is equivalent to 8 unselected referrals or
3 NEWS high risk referrals per 1,000 overnight admissions. As critical
care outreach provision decreased then the number of patients assessed
fell (supplementary Table 1). Winter was busier (IRR 1.22, 95%CI 1.14 to
1.31), and weekends quieter (IRR 0.87, 95%CI 0.82 to 0.92) than the rest
of year. When we included a measure of case finding in the models (cases
assessed per 1000 overnight hospital admissions), referral incidence
increased initially but may have begun to plateau for the hospitals with
referral rates in the highest quartile (supplementary Figure 2).

Patient characteristics
-----------------------

Table 1 shows the baseline data for all ward patients assessed. Sepsis
was reported in 9296 patients (61%). Of these, the respiratory system
was considered to be the source in half (4772, 51%). Organ failure,
defined as a SOFA score greater than or equal to two, was present in
5164 of patients (34%). 1427 patients (9%) were in respiratory failure,
2931 (19%) were in renal failure, and 4636 (31%) were shocked. Organ
support at the time of assessment was uncommon (870 patients, 6%).

2708 (18%) patients died during the 7-days following ward assessment.
Mortality was heavily front-loaded with 1539 (57%) of these deaths
occuring in the first 48 hours (supplementary Figure 3). There was a
clear correlation between physiological severity and early (7-day)
mortality using either ward based (NEWS) or critical care scoring
systems (SOFA, ICNARC) (supplementary Figure 3). For example, the 7-day
mortality was 9% (328 deaths), 15% (629 deaths), and 26% (1734
deaths)for NEWS low, medium and high risk classes respectively.

The critical care assessor judged that 5321 patients (35%) required
critical care. These patients had a higher physiological severity of
illness (ICNARC physiology score 17.6 versus 14.3, 95% confidence
interval for difference 3.0 to 3.5), and a greater 7-day mortality
(19.6% versus 17.0%, difference 1.3% to 4.0%). There was a clear
correlation between measured severity and the assessors judgement of
need (supplementary Figure 5).

Overall mortality at 90-days was 35% (5337 patients), and at one year
was 39% (5068 patients) respectively.

Patient pathways following ward assessment
------------------------------------------

Patients were classified into three groups following the ward
assessment: those refused admission with treatment limits (pre-existing
or otherwise); those refused admission without treatment limits (active
ward care); and, those offered immediate critical care (Figure 1).

There were 2141 patients (14%) refused with treatment limits, 9471
patients (62%) assigned to active ward-care, and 3546 patients (23%)
immediately offered critical care.

### Refused critical care with treatment limits

The 2141 patients with treatment limits had a 7-day mortality of 41%
(881 deaths). The initial decision to refuse admission was reversed in
just 76 patients (4%) of whom 26 (34%) died within the week. Although
the final 90-day mortality was substantial 65% (1402 deaths), 506
patients (24%) survived a year despite the decision.

Patients refused with treatment limits were older (77 versus 66 years,
95%CI for difference 11 to 12 years), and more acutely unwell (17.1 vs
13.9 ICNARC points, difference 2.8 to 3.6) than those assigned active
ward care. Critical care occupancy did not affect the proportion of
patients refused admission with treatment limits (Table 2).

### Active ward care

The 9471 patients for active ward care had a 7-day mortality of 12%
(1102 deaths). Most deaths (799 deaths 73%) occured on the ward but 303
deaths (27%) followed delayed critical care admission. The initial
decision to refuse critical care was reversed for 1745 patients (18%),
so a total of 2544 (27%) patients died or were admitted to critical
care.

The active ward care group included 1601 (17%) patients who had been
recommended critical care on assessment. These patients had a higher
7-day mortality (18% versus 10%, 95% confidence interval for difference
5% to 9%), and were more likely to have the initial refusal reversed
(36% versus 15%, risk difference 19% to 24%).

### Immediate critical care

The 3546 patients immediately accepted to critical care had a 7-day
mortality of 20% (725 deaths). Just 42 (6%) of those deaths occurred
before admission was arranged, but a further 254 patients (9%) were
never admitted but survived nonetheless.

Those offered immediate admission were marginally younger (64.1 versus
65.6 years, 95%CI 0.8 to 2.2 years), but distinctly more unwell (18.1
versus 13.9 ICNARC physiology points, 95%CI 3.9 to 4.5) than the active
ward care group. As critical care occupancy at the time of the ward
assessment increased, patients were less likely to be immediately
accepted (Table 2, Cochran-Armitage test for trend p&lt;0.0001).

Delay to admission to critical care
-----------------------------------

The median delay between assessment and admission for patients
immediately accepted was 2 hours (IQR 1 to 4) compared to 12 hours (IQR
5 to 29) for late admissions from the active ward care group (median
additional delay 9 hours, IQR 9 to 10) (Figure 2a). This meant that 2277
(74%) admissions were achieved within 4 hours for those immediately
accepted versus 256 (16%) for those initially refused (risk difference
58%, 95%CI 56% to 60%). For the subgroup recommended to critical care
whose initial refusal was later reversed, the median delay to admission
was 8 hours (IQR 3 to 22).

<!-- @resume(2016-03-02): bed pressure phrasing ... -->
Increasing occupancy at assessment increased the median delay from 3
(low bed pressure), to 4 (medium pressure), to 6 hours (high pressure,
Figure 2b, Cochran-Armitage test for trend p&lt;0.0001).

Determinants of a decision to admit
-----------------------------------

We built a multi-level (patients nested within hospitals) logistic
regression model to examine factors associated with a decision to admit
for patients without treatment limits (Table 3). As with the univariate
comparisons above, older patients were less likely to be admitted
(patients over 80 years: odds ratio 0.60, 0.53 to 0.69), and more
acutely unwell patients were more likely to be admitted (OR 1.07 per
ICNARC physiology point, 95% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.07).
Similarly, patients already receiving organ support (1.83, 1.55 to
2.16), or clinically judged to be peri-arrest (6.32, 5.18 to 7.70) were
also more likely to be admitted.

Patients referred out-of-hours (7pm-7am), during the weekend, or during
the winter were more likely to be offered critical care (odds ratios
between 1.04 to 1.33), but those assessed when bed pressure was high (OR
0.70, 0.57 to 0.86), or medium (0.87, 0.77 to 0.98) were less likely to
be accepted. We estimated that in this sample had there been no
limitations on capacity then an additional 122 patients (95%CI 53 to
186) would have been immediately accepted.

The model also demonstrated significant hospital level variation with a
Median Odds Ratio (MOR) of 2.11 (95% confidence interval 1.81 to 2.42)
which differed little to that estimated excluding patient predictors
(MOR 2.18, 1.82 to 2.60). The MOR summarises the differences when
comparing decision making for similar patients from any two randomly
selected hospitals, and consistency when excluding patient level
predictors suggests that it is a true hospital level difference.

Determinants of prompt admission
--------------------------------

The modelling was repeated but now with the delivery of admission to
critical care within 4 hours (a prompt admission) as the outcome, and
the decision to admit as an additional predictor (Table 3). We excluded
an additional 358 (2.4%) patients where surgery between assessment and
admission inevitably delayed that admission.

The associations between prompt admission and patient level predictors
were broadly similar with younger and sicker patients being admitted
more promptly. However, patients assessed during the winter, while being
more likely to be offered critical care, were now less likely to be
admitted promptly (odds ratio 0.76, 0.64 to 0.90). The strongest
predictor of prompt admission was a decision to admit at the initial
bedside assessment (odds ratio 69, 59 to 81). Even though the decision
to admit was included in the model, bed pressure still had a marked
effect (high pressure: 0.27, 0.19 to 0.37) and hospital level variation
persisted (MOR 1.89, 1.63 to 2.21).

Determinants of 90-day mortality
--------------------------------

Amongst patients without treatment limits, there were 372 deaths (3%) by
the end of the first day, 1742 (13%) by the end of the first week, 3130
(24%) by the end of the first month, and 3946(30%) by 90 days
(proportions from Kaplan-Meier failure function).

A series of models were fitted with 90-day survival as the dependent
variable for patients without treatment limits. The final best model
(Table 4) incorporated a time-varying effect for measured physiological
severity and reported peri-arrest status such that their effects were
attenuated after the first week (supplementary Figure 6).

Other patient level risk factors were consistent with the existing
literature on outcomes in similar patients: older patients, and those
with sepsis (other than genito-urinary) had worse
survival.\[@Harrison:2004brb\] Patients assessed during the winter
months, over the weekend, and out-of-hours did not have a significantly
worse adjusted survival than baseline.

Critical care occupancy did not affect adjusted mortality in the
multi-level model (high pressure: hazard ratio 1.03, 95% confidence
interval 0.90 to 1.17). A single level model (supplementary Table 2),
constructed in case occupancy was mediated through rather than
confounded by the effect of the hospital, similarly could not exclude a
null effect (hazard ratio 1.07, 1.00 to 1.15, p=0.06).

The full multi-level model demonstrated significant hospital level
variation in survival (median hazard ratio 1.28, 1.22 to 1.34) which was
little altered by adjustment for patient level risk factors (MHR 1.29,
1.22 to 1.35).

Repeating the survival model in the subgroup recommended to critical
care at the initial assessment produced similar effects albeit with less
precision (supplementary Table 2).
