48 hospitals reported 20893 visits over 435 months. 2694 visits (12.9%)
did not meet the inclusion criteria including 1860 (8.9%) repeat visits,
and 586 (2.8%) patients recently discharged from critical care. Data
linkage was incomplete (&lt; 80%) for 66 (15%) study-months excluding a
further 2440 (11.7%) visits. Therefore 15759 patients were recruited to
the study, of which 15158 (96.1%) completed follow-up without error and
were available for analysis (Figure 1a). Final data linkage (ward visits
to critical care admissions) was 93% complete.

Participating hospitals
-----------------------

The participating hospitals comprised 10 teaching and 38 general
hospitals that each collected data between September 2010 and December
2011 for a median of 8 months (IQR 5--9 months). Each hospital
contributed a median of 252 patients (IQR 162--380) equivalent to 6
patients referred to critical care (IQR 3--9) per 1,000 overnight
admissions. Critical Care Outreach Teams (CCOT) operated 24 hours/day
and 7 days/week in 14 (29%) hospitals, less than 24 hours/day in 19
(40%) hospitals, and less than 7 days/week in 13 (27%) hospitals. Two
hospitals had no CCOT.

There was a median of 12 (IQR 9--18) critical care beds per hospital
(mixed Level 2 \[typically intensive monitoring or single organ
support\], and Level 3 \[ventilated or multiple organ support\]), most
often in a single physical location (45 hospitals).

Incidence of critical care referrals
------------------------------------

<!-- numbers here from stata log files for incidence models -->
We estimated the mean baseline (non-teaching hospital with 50,000
admissions per year and 24/7 CCOT provision) incidence of referrals to
critical care at 46 (95%CI 50--54) patients per month of which 17 (95%CI
17--18) patients met the NEWS high risk criteria at assessment. As
critical care outreach provision decreased then the number of patients
assessed fell (supplementary Table 1). Winter was busier (IRR 1.22,
95%CI 1.14--1.31), and weekends quieter (IRR 0.87, 95%CI 0.82-0.92) than
non-winter weekday periods. When we included a measure of case finding
in the models (cases assessed per 1000 overnight hospital admissions),
referral incidence increased initially but may have begun to plateau for
the hospitals with referral rates in the highest quartile (supplementary
Figure 1).

Patient characteristics
-----------------------

Table 1 shows the baseline data for all ward patients assessed. Sepsis
was reported in (9296, 61%) patients. Of these, the respiratory system
was considered to be the source in half (4772, 51%). Organ failure,
defined as a SOFA score greater than or equal to two, was present in
5164 (34%) of patients. 1427 patients (9%) were in respiratory failure,
2931 (19%) were in renal failure, and 4636 (31%) were shocked. Organ
support at the time of assessment was, however, uncommon (870 patients
\[6%\]).

Overall, 2708 (18%) patients died during the 7-days following ward
assessment. Mortality was heavily front-loaded with 1539 (57%) of these
deaths occuring in the first 48 hours (supplementary Figure 2). There
was a clear correlation between physiological severity and early (7-day)
mortality using either ward based (NEWS) or critical care scoring
systems (SOFA, ICNARC) (supplementary Figure 3). For example, the 7-day
mortality was 9% (328 deaths), 15% (15% deaths), and 26% (1734
deaths)for NEWS low, medium and high risk classes respectively.

Patient pathways following ward assessment
------------------------------------------

We extracted two clinical decisions at the point of the bedside
assessment. We asked whether the bedside assessor would recommend the
patient for critical care (5321 patients \[35%\]) or ward care (9837
patients \[65%\]) (Figure 1b). Additionally, we recorded the decision to
admit (Figure 1c), and classified patients as either initially refused
(9471 patients \[62%\]) without treatment limits, initially refused with
treatment limits (2141 patients \[14%\]), or immediately accepted to
critical care (3546 patients \[23%\]). Amongst those recommended for
critical care, the proportions initially refused without treatment
limits, initially refused with limits, or immediately accepted were 30%
(1601 patients), 6% (345 patients), and 63% (3375 patients)
respectively.

We then tracked patient pathways over the following week.

### Patients with treatment limits refused critical care

These 2141 patients had a 7-day mortality of 41% (881 deaths). The
initial decision to refuse admission was reversed in just 76 patients
(4%) of whom 26 (34%) died within the week.

Compared to those refused without a treatment limitation order, this
cohort was older (77 vs 66 years, 95%CI for difference 11--12 years),
and more acutely unwell (3.6 vs 2.8 SOFA points, 95%CI for difference
0.7--0.9). The final 90-day mortality was substantial 65% (1402 deaths),
nonetheless 506 patients (24%) survived a year despite the decision.

We did not consider these patients further.

### Patients without treatment limits refused critical care

Patients without treatment limits initially refused critical care had a
7-day mortality of 12% (1102 deaths). Most deaths (799 deaths 73%)
occured on the ward without critical care but 303 deaths (27%) followed
delayed admission. Within the week, the initial decision to refuse was
reversed in 1745 patients (18%), so a total of 2544 (27%) patients died
or were admitted to critical care.

7-day mortality was higher for those recommended but refused (17.6%
versus 10.4% \[risk difference 7.1% 95%CI 5.1--9.1%\]), and for those
where the initial decision to refuse was reversed (17.4% versus 10.3%
\[risk difference 7.0% 95%CI 5.1--9.0%\]).

### Patients immediately accepted to critical care

The 3546 (23%) patients accepted to critical care at the initial bedside
assessment had a 7-day mortality of 20% (725 deaths). Just 42 (6%) of
those deaths occurred before admission was arranged, but a further 254
patients (9%) were never admitted but survived regardless.

Those offered admission were marginally younger (64.1 versus 65.6 years,
95%CI 0.8--2.2 years), and more acutely unwell (4.1 versus 2.8 SOFA
points, 95%CI 1.2--1.3).

The median delay between assessment and admission for these patients was
2 hours (IQR 1--4) compared to 12 hours (IQR 5--29) for those refused
without treatment limits (median additional delay 9 hours, IQR 9--10)
(Figure 2). This meant that 2277 (74%) admissions were achieved within 4
hours for those initially accepted versus 256 (16%) for those initially
refused (risk difference 58%, 95%CI 56--60%).

Critical care occupancy
-----------------------

There were 1198 (8%) patients assessed when the unit was full, 3757
(25%) assessed when there were either one or two beds available, and
10197 (67%) assessed when there were more than two beds available (Table
2). Critical care occupancy fluctuated with time of the day, day of the
week, and season of the year (supplementary Figure 4).

As occupancy at the time of assessment increased, patients were less
likely to be immediately, or ever, accepted to critical care; less
likely to be admitted promptly; and, more likely to die on the ward
without critical admission (Table 2, Cochran-Armitage test for trend
p&lt;0.0001 for all measures).

Determinants of a decision to admit
-----------------------------------

We built a multi-level (patients nested within hospitals) logistic
regression model to examine factors associated with a decision to admit
for patients without treatment limits (Table 3a). As with the univariate
comparisons above, older patients were less likely to be admitted (OR
0.60 for patients over 80 years, 95%CI 0.53--0.69), and more acutely
unwell patients were more likely to be admitted (OR 1.07 per ICNARC
physiology point (e.g. an increase in heart rate from 105 to 115), 95%CI
1.06--1.07). Similarly, patients already receiving organ support (OR
1.83 95%CI 1.55--2.16), or clinically judged to be peri-arrest (OR 6.32
95%CI 5.18--7.70) were also more likely to be admitted.

Patients referred out-of-hours (7pm-7am), during the weekend, or during
the winter were more likely to be offered critical care (95%CI for odds
ratios from 1.04 to 1.33), but those assessed when the critical care
unit was at, or near capacity were less likely to be admitted (OR 0.70,
95%CI 0.57--0.86, and OR 0.87 95%CI 0.77--0.98 respectively). We
estimated that in this sample had there been no limitations on capacity
then an additional 122 patients (95%CI 53-186) would have been admitted.

The model also demonstrated significant hospital level variation with a
Median Odds Ratio (MOR) of 2.11 (95%CI 1.81-2.42) which differed little
to that estimated excluding patient predictors (MOR 2.18 \[95%CI
1.82--2.60\]). The MOR summarises the differences when comparing
decision making for patients in any two randomly selected hospitals, and
consistency when excluding patient level predictors suggests that it is
a true hospital level difference.

Determinants of prompt admission
--------------------------------

The modelling was repeated but now with the delivery of admission to
critical care within 4 hours (a prompt admission) as the outcome, and
the decision to admit as an additional predictor (Table 3b). We excluded
an additional 358 (2.4%) patients where surgery between assessment and
admission inevitably delayed that admission.

The associations between prompt admission and patient level predictors
were broadly similar with younger and sicker patients being admitted
more promptly (Table TTT). However, patients assessed during the winter,
while being more likely to be offered critical care, were now less
likely to be admitted promptly (OR 0.76, 95%CI 0.64--0.90). The
strongest predictor of prompt admission was a decision to admit at the
initial bedside assessment (OR 69 95%CI 59--81). Even though the
decision to admit was included in the model, occupancy still had a
marked effect (OR 0.27 \[95%CI 0.19--0.37\] for the 1170 (8%) patients
assessed when critical care was full). Hospital level variation
persisted: MOR 1.89 (95%CI 1.63--2.21).

Determinants of 90-day mortality
--------------------------------

Amongst patients without treatment limits, there were 372 deaths by the
end of the first day, 1742 by the end of the first week, 3130 by the end
of the first month, and 3946 by 90 days. The risk of death at these time
points was 3%, 13%, 24%, and 30% respectively (Kaplan-Meier failure
function).

A series of models were fitted with 90-day survival as the dependent
variable for patients without treatment limits. The final best model
(Table 4) incorporated a time-varying effect for acute physiological
severity such that its effect was attenuated after the first week
(supplementary Figure 5).

Other patient level risk factors were consistent with the existing
literature on outcomes in similar patients: older patients, and those
with sepsis (other than genito-urinary) had worse outcomes.\[Harrison,
2007\] Patients assessed during the winter months, over the weekend, and
out-of-hours did not have a significantly worse adjusted survival than
baseline.

Critical care occupancy did not affect adjusted mortality in the
multi-level model (e.g. HR 1.03, 95%CI 0.90--1.17 for patients assessed
when the critical care was full). A single level model, constructed in
case occupancy was mediated rather than confounded by the effect of
hospital, similarly could not exclude a null effect (HR 1.07, 95%CI
1.00--1.15).

The full multi-level model demonstrated significant hospital level
variation in survival (MHR 1.28, 95%CI 1.22--1.34) which was little
altered by adjustment for patient level risk factors (MHR 1.29, 95%CI
1.22--1.35).
