48 hospitals reported 20,893 visits for ward assessment over 435 study
months. 2,694 visits (12.9%) did not meet the inclusion criteria
including 1,860 (8.9%) repeat assessments, and 586 (2.8%) assessments
for recent critical care discharges. Data linkage did not meet the
quality control level (&gt; 80%) for 66 (15%) study-months excluding a
further 2,440 (11.7%) visits. Of the 15,759 patients remaining, 15,158
(96.1%) completed follow-up without error and were available for
analysis (Figure 1). Final data linkage (ward visits to critical care
admissions) was 93% complete.

Participating hospitals
-----------------------

Participating hospitals comprised 10 teaching and 38 general hospitals
collecting data for a median of 8 months (IQR 5 to 9 months) between
September 2010 and December 2011. Each contributed a median of 252
patients (IQR 162 to 380). CCOTs operated 24 hours/day and 7 days/week
in 14 (29%) hospitals, less than 24 hours/day in 19 (40%) hospitals, and
less than 7 days/week in 13 (27%) hospitals. Two hospitals had no CCOT.

There was a median of 12 (IQR 9 to 18) adult general critical care beds
per hospital (mixed Level 2 \[typically intensive monitoring or single
organ support\], and Level 3 \[ventilated or multiple organ support\]),
most often co-located in a single physical location (45 hospitals).

Bed pressure was high (zero or fewer available beds) at the time of 1198
(8%) ward assessments, medium (one or two beds available) for 3757 (25%)
assessments, and low (three or more beds available) for the remaining
10197 (67%) assessments. Critical care occupancy fluctuated with time of
the day, day of the week, and season of the year (supplementary Figure
1).

Incidence of referrals for ward assessment by critical care
-----------------------------------------------------------

The mean baseline incidence of referrals to critical care (for a
non-teaching hospital with 60,000 admissions per year and 24/7 CCOT
provision) was 46 (95%CI 50 to 54) patients per month of whom 17 (95%CI
17 to 18) patients met the NEWS high risk criteria at assessment. This
is equivalent to 8 unselected referrals or 3 NEWS high risk referrals
per 1,000 overnight admissions.

With decreasing provision of critical care outreach, the number of
patients assessed also fell (supplementary Table 1). Winter was busier
(IRR 1.22, 95%CI 1.14 to 1.31), and weekends quieter (IRR 0.87, 95%CI
0.82 to 0.92) than the rest of the year. When a measure of case finding
was included in the models (cases assessed per 1000 overnight hospital
admissions), referral incidence increased initially but then began to
plateau for those hospitals with referral rates in the highest quartile
(supplementary Figure 2).

Patient characteristics and outcomes
------------------------------------

Table 1 presents the baseline data for all ward patients assessed.
Sepsis was reported in 9296 patients (61%). Of these, the respiratory
system was considered to be the source about half (4772, 51%). Organ
failure, defined as a SOFA score greater than or equal to two, was
present in 5164 of patients (34%). 1427 patients (9%) were in
respiratory failure, 2931 (19%) were in renal failure, and 4636 (31%)
were in cardiovascular shock. Organ support at the time of assessment
was uncommon (870 patients, 6%).

2708 (18%) patients died during the 7-days following ward assessment.
Mortality was heavily front-loaded with 1539 (57%) of these deaths
occuring within the first 48 hours (supplementary Figure 3). There was a
clear correlation between physiological severity and early (7-day)
mortality using either ward based (NEWS) or critical care scoring
systems (SOFA, ICNARC) (supplementary Figure 3). As an example, the
7-day mortality was 9% (328 deaths), 15% (629 deaths), and 26% (1734
deaths)for NEWS low, medium and high risk classes respectively.

The critical care assessors judged that 5321 patients (35%) required
critical care. These patients had a higher physiological severity of
illness (ICNARC physiology score 17.6 versus 14.3, 95% confidence
interval for difference 3.0 to 3.5), and a greater 7-day mortality
(19.6% versus 17.0%, difference 1.3% to 4.0%). There was a clear
correlation between measured severity and the assessors' judgements of
need (supplementary Figure 5).

<!-- - [ ] TODO(2016-05-23): check this is *overall* -->
Overall mortality at 90-days was 35% (5337 patients), and at one year
was 44% (6703 patients).

Patient pathways following ward assessment by critical care
-----------------------------------------------------------

Patients were classified into three groups following the initial ward
assessment: 2141 patients (14%) declined admission with treatment limits
(pre-existing or newly-placed); 9471 patients (62%) declined admission
without treatment limits (Ongoing ward care); and 3546 patients (23%)
offered immediate critical care.

### Declined critical care with treatment limits

The 2141 patients with treatment limits had a 7-day mortality of 41%
(881 deaths). The initial decision to decline admission was reversed in
just 76 patients (4%) of whom 26 (34%) died within the week. Although
the final 90-day mortality was substantial 65% (1402 deaths), 506
patients (24%) survived for at least year despite the decision.

Patients declined critical care with treatment limits were older (77
versus 66 years, 95%CI for difference 11 to 12 years), and more acutely
unwell (17.1 versus 13.9 ICNARC physiology points, 95%CI for the
difference 2.8 to 3.6) than those assigned Ongoing ward care. Critical
care occupancy did not affect the proportion of patients declined
admission with treatment limits (Table 2).

### Ongoing ward care

The 9471 patients for ongoing ward care had a 7-day mortality of 12%
(1102 deaths). Most deaths (799 deaths 73%) occured on the ward but 303
deaths (27%) followed delayed critical care admission. The initial
decision to decline critical care was reversed within the week for 1745
patients (18%), so a total of 2544 (27%) patients died or were admitted
to critical care.

The ongoing ward care group included 1601 (17%) patients who had
nonetheless been recommended critical care by the assessor. These
patients had a higher 7-day mortality (18% versus 10%, 95% confidence
interval for difference 5% to 9%), and were more likely to have the
initial refusal reversed (36% versus 15%, risk difference 19% to 24%).

### Immediate critical care

The 3546 patients immediately accepted to critical care had a 7-day
mortality of 20% (725 deaths). Just 42 (6%) of those deaths occurred
before admission was arranged, but a further 254 patients (9%) were
never admitted but survived nonetheless.

Those offered immediate admission were marginally younger (64.1 versus
65.6 years, 95%CI 0.8 to 2.2 years), but distinctly more unwell (18.1
versus 13.9 ICNARC physiology points, 95%CI 3.9 to 4.5) than the ongoing
ward care group. As critical care occupancy at the time of the ward
assessment increased, patients were less likely to be immediately
accepted (Table 2, Cochran-Armitage test for trend p&lt;0.0001).

Delay to admission to critical care
-----------------------------------

The median delay between assessment and admission for patients
immediately accepted was 2 hours (IQR 1 to 4) compared to 12 hours (IQR
5 to 29) for those whose initial refusal was subsequently reversed
(median additional delay 9 hours, IQR 9 to 10) (Figure 2a). Thus prompt
admission (within 4 hours) was delivered for 2277 patients (74%) when
immediately accepted versus 256 (16%) when initially declined (risk
difference 58%, 95%CI 56% to 60%).

For the subgroup of 580 ongoing ward care patients who had been
recommended for critical care (by their assessor), but were initially
declined, and later had that refusal reversed, the median delay to
admission was 8 hours (IQR 3 to 22).

Increasing occupancy at assessment increased the median delay from 3
(low bed pressure), to 4 (medium pressure), to 6 hours (high pressure,
Figure 2b, Jonckheere-Terpstra test for trend p=0.0004).

Determinants of a decision to admit
-----------------------------------

We built a multi-level (patients nested within hospitals) logistic
regression model to examine factors associated with a decision to admit
for patients without treatment limits (Table 3). As with the univariate
comparisons above, older patients were less likely to be admitted
(patients over 80 years: odds ratio 0.60, 0.53 to 0.69), and more
acutely unwell patients were more likely to be admitted (OR 1.07 per
ICNARC physiology point, 95% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.07).
Similarly, patients already receiving organ support (1.83, 1.55 to
2.16), or clinically judged to be peri-arrest (6.32, 5.18 to 7.70) were
also more likely to be admitted.

Patients referred out-of-hours (7pm-7am), during the weekend, or during
the winter were more likely to be offered critical care (odds ratios
between 1.04 to 1.33), but those assessed when bed pressures were high
(OR 0.70, 0.57 to 0.86), or medium (0.87, 0.77 to 0.98) were less likely
to be accepted. We estimated, that in this sample, an additional 122
patients (95%CI 53 to 186) would have been immediately accepted had
there been no limitations on critical care capacity.

The model also demonstrated significant hospital level variation with a
MOR of 2.11 (95% confidence interval 1.81 to 2.42) which differed little
to that estimated excluding patient predictors (MOR 2.18, 1.82 to 2.60).
The MOR summarises the differences when comparing decision making for
similar patients from any two randomly selected hospitals, and
consistency when excluding patient level predictors suggests that it is
a true hospital level difference.

Determinants of prompt admission
--------------------------------

The modelling was repeated but now with the delivery of admission to
critical care within 4 hours (a prompt admission) as the outcome, and
the decision to admit as an additional predictor (Table 3). In this
analysis, we also excluded 358 (2.4%) patients whose admission was
inevitably delayed urgent surgery.

The patient-level predictors of prompt admission were broadly similar to
those for decisions to admit, with younger and sicker patients being
admitted more promptly. However, patients assessed during the winter,
while being more likely to be offered critical care, were less likely to
be admitted promptly (OR 0.76, 0.64 to 0.90). The strongest predictor of
prompt admission was a decision to admit at the initial bedside
assessment (OR 69, 59 to 81). Even though the decision to admit was
included in the model, bed pressure still had a marked effect (high
pressure: 0.27, 0.19 to 0.37) and hospital level variation persisted
(MOR 1.89, 1.63 to 2.21).

Determinants of 90-day mortality
--------------------------------

Amongst patients without treatment limits, there were 372 deaths (3%) by
the end of the first day, 1742 (13%) by the end of the first week, 3130
(24%) by the 30 days, and 3946(30%) by 90 days (proportions from
Kaplan-Meier failure function).

A series of models were fitted with 90-day survival as the dependent
variable for patients without treatment limits. The final best model
(Table 4) incorporated a time-varying effect for measured physiological
severity and reported peri-arrest status such that their effects were
attenuated after the first week (supplementary Figure 6).

Other patient level risk factors were consistent with the existing
literature on outcomes in similar patients: older patients, and those
with sepsis (other than genito-urinary) had worse
survival.\[@Harrison:2004brb\] Patients assessed during the winter
months, over the weekend, and out-of-hours did not have a significantly
worse adjusted survival than baseline.

Critical care occupancy did not affect adjusted mortality in the
multi-level model (high pressure: hazard ratio 1.03, 95% confidence
interval 0.90 to 1.17). A single level model (supplementary Table 2),
constructed in case occupancy was mediated through rather than
confounded by the effect of the hospital, similarly could not exclude a
null effect (hazard ratio 1.07, 1.00 to 1.15, p=0.06).

The full multi-level model demonstrated significant hospital level
variation in survival (MHR 1.28, 1.22 to 1.34) which was little altered
by adjustment for patient level risk factors (MHR 1.29, 1.22 to 1.35).

Repeating the survival model in the subgroup recommended to critical
care at the initial assessment produced similar effects albeit with less
precision (supplementary Table 2).
