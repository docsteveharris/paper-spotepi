Background
----------

Identifying and responding to deterioration among ward patients includes
early access to critical care. However, critical care provision in the
NHS is constrained, delay to admission is thought likely, and patient
outcomes are poorly understood.

Methods
-------

We conducted a prospective cohort study of consecutive deteriorating
ward patients referred to critical care in 48 NHS hospitals (1 November
2010 --- 31 December 2011). We recorded both the assessor's
recommendation for critical care, and the decision to admit. Admissions
to critical care within one week, and deaths within one year were
defined by linking to national registries. Incidence models were
stratified by the NHS National Early Warning Score (NEWS) risk class,
and used generalised estimating equations. Decision making and survival
were modelled with random effects for the hospital using logistic
regression and proportional hazards models respectively.

Findings
--------

Critical care teams assessed 15158 patients of whom 6759 (45%) were in
the highest NEWS risk class giving an incidence of 17 high risk patients
(95%CI 17--18) per hospital per month. 5164 (34%) patients were in
established organ failure with only 870 patients (6%) already on organ
support. Sepsis was reported in 9296 (61%) patients.

2141 (14%) patients with treatment limitation orders were refused
critical care with 7-day, 90-day, and 1-year mortalities of 41%, 65%,
and 76% respectively. They were not considered further.

The bedside assessor recommended 4976 (38%) of the remainder to critical
care of whom 3375 (68%) were initally accepted. The median delay between
asssessment and admission was 2 hours (IQR 1 to 4). Patients over 80
years were less likely to be accepted (OR 0.60 95%CI 0.53--0.69).
Despite adjustment for patient specific risk factors, decision making
varied markedly between hospitals (median interhospital OR 2.11,
95%1.81--2.42).

Of the 1601 (32%) patients recommended but initially refused, 1021 (64%)
were admitted later with a median additional delay of 6 hours (IQR
5--7). A further 179 (11.2%) patients recommended and refused died
without admission.

Without treatment limits, 7-day, 90-day, and 1-year mortalities were
14%, 30%, and 39% respectively. Even within the first week, mortality
was front-loaded with 964 (53%) within two days. Survival also varied
between hospitals with a median interhospital hazard ratio of 1.29
(95%CI, 1.22--1.35).

The critical care unit was full at the time of 1198 (8%) assessments.
These patients were less likely to be accepted to critical care (OR 0.72
\[95%CI 0.59--0.88\]), and less likely to be admitted promptly (OR 0.27
\[95%CI 0.19--.27\]). Increasing occupancy was associated with greater
physiological deterioration pending admission (Cochran-Armitage test for
trend p=0.01). We could not exclude an effect of occupancy on 90-day
survival (HR 1.07, 95%CI 1.00â€“1.15).

Conclusion
----------

Deteriorating ward patients referred to critical care are vulnerable
with a high initial mortality. Despite clinical recommendation for
admission a substantial minority die without admission, and high
critical care occupancy both predujices and delays admission.
