## Sensitivity Analyses

### Data linkage quality

Data linkage rates between the (SPOT)light data and the ICNARC CMP data were used throughout the study to monitor quality. Where eligible admissions to a critical care unit were reported to the ICNARC CMP but not found in the (SPOT)light reports, then the concern was that ward referrals to ICU were not being captured. Hospitals were required to meet a minimum standard of 80% capture during the first three months, and, even after this period, those months where the data quality fell below this standard were also excluded. 

The incidence, severity, and survival models were therefore repeated using the additional data submitted that was 70--80% complete --- the 'all' data set. This included an additional 11 hospitals, 85 study months and 3,670 patients. Similarly, the analysis was repeated amongst those hospitals meeting a higher 95% threshold --- the 'best' data set (44 hospitals, 219 study months, and 9,179 patients). The mean data linkage proportions in the 'all', 'study' and 'best' data sets were 92·3%, 93·5%, and 99·8%. 

The baseline incidence of NEWS High Risk patients was slightly lower among the 44 hospitals in the 'best' data set with an estimated incidence of 4·5 (95%CI 4·1--4·9) versus 5·0 (95%CI 4·7--5·4) patients per hospital per week. Otherwise the approximate magnitude and direction of the effect of all hospital and timing risk factors were very similar


## Estimation of relative survival

Estimation of relative survival was performed using the `strel2` package in Stata where the expected survival was derived from life tables based on data from the UK census and Office of National Statistics (ONS) records. These were compiled by the Cancer Research UK Cancer Survival Group at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and were downloaded fromhttp://www.lshtm.ac.uk/eph/ncde/cancersurvival/tools/registered/lifetables.html in May 2014.
